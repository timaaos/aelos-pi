# aelos-pi
A Raspberry Pi modification for Aelos Bot
## Components:
- [Waveshare Servo Driver HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Servo_Driver_HAT)
- [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/)
- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)
## Why we made this?
Be honest, Aelos software is bad. So we made custom software for Aelos Bot. Its better, because without bugs like yesterday worked, today not working.
